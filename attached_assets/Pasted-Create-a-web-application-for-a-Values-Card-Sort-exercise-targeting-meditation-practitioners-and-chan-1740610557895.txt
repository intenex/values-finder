Create a web application for a Values Card Sort exercise targeting meditation practitioners and changemakers. This app should help users identify their top 10 personal values through a series of comparative choices.

App Requirements:
1. Start with a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the exercise

2. Present users with pairs of values in a "hot or not" style comparison:
   - Show two values side by side with their descriptions
   - Use the prompt: "If you could only have one of these values in your life..."
   - After approximately 20-25 comparisons, use 3-5 AI-generated deeper questions to refine the selection
   - Based on these responses, automatically determine their top 10 values

3. Let users review and customize their top 10 values:
   - Edit any value name
   - Edit any value description
   - Replace a value with a custom one if desired

4. Allow users to rate how well they've lived according to each value in the past 3 months (scale 1-10)

Values Data:
Use the following 83 standard values from Miller's Values Card Sort plus these 10 additional values that are particularly relevant to meditators and changemakers:

- PRESENCE: to be fully engaged in the current moment
- EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: to understand and work skillfully with my emotions
- CATALYST: to initiate positive change in systems and communities
- INTEGRITY: to align my actions with my deepest values
- TRANSMISSION: to share my spiritual experience to benefit others
- VULNERABILITY: to be open about my true feelings and experiences
- IMPACT: to create lasting positive change in the world
- EQUANIMITY: to maintain balance amid life's ups and downs
- COMMUNITY: to be part of a supportive growth-oriented group
- AUTHENTICITY: to live in alignment with my true nature

Technical Specifications:
- Create a single-page React application
- Structure the CSS with clear class names and organization for easy future styling changes
- Use CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, etc. to enable easy theming later
- Set up the app with modular components that can be easily modified
- Make it mobile-responsive
- No backend required; all processing happens client-side
- Allow users to save or export their final values list

Future Styling Considerations (implement skeleton/hooks for these):
- Include placeholder spots for potential background images behind value cards
- Add animation hooks for selection interactions (color changes, scaling effects)
- Set up basic sound effect capability that can be triggered on value selection
- Create a theme provider/context to easily switch between different visual styles
- Include a simple settings panel structure for future styling options

Implementation Notes:
- For the comparison algorithm, use a scoring system (+1 for chosen values, -1 for rejected)
- The comparison process should feel meaningful and engaging, not tedious
- Keep all standard values including potentially "non-spiritual" ones like FAME, ATTRACTIVENESS, and POPULARITY to allow for authentic self-discovery
- Ensure the editing interface is intuitive and straightforward
- Structure the code to make future UI/UX enhancements straightforward

The goal is to help users discover their core values in a way that feels authentic and personally meaningful, supporting their meditation practice and aspirations as changemakers, while also creating an engaging and dopamine-supportive user experience.
