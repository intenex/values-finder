Please update the Values Card Sort application to include an AI questioning phase after the initial comparisons. This is an important enhancement to help users refine their selection more thoughtfully.

After the user completes about 20-25 value comparisons and the system has identified their top 20-25 values, implement the following:

1. AI Questioning Phase:
   - Add a new screen that explains: "Now let's go deeper with a few questions about your values."
   - Present 3-5 thought-provoking questions such as:
     * "Which of these values would you be most willing to sacrifice in a difficult situation?"
     * "Which of these values do you wish was more present in your community?"
     * "If you could only pass one of these values to future generations, which would it be?"
     * "Which value feels most authentically 'you' regardless of what others think?"
     * "Which value, if lived fully, would have the greatest positive impact on your life?"
   - For each question, allow the user to select from their shortlisted values
   - Use these responses to further refine the final top 10 values (+2 points for values selected during this phase)

2. Technical Implementation:
   - Create a QuestioningPhase component between the comparison phase and the review phase
   - Use the shortlisted values from the comparison phase as options for the questions
   - Design an engaging interface for this phase that feels different from the comparison screens
   - Ensure the algorithm properly weighs these responses when determining the final top 10

3. UI/UX Considerations:
   - Add a progress indicator showing they're in phase 2 of the process
   - Make the questions appear one at a time
   - Allow users to see which values they're choosing from (their top 20-25 from the first phase)
   - Add meaningful transitions between questions

This addition will make the values selection process more thoughtful and meaningful, helping users arrive at a more authentic set of top values.

Please integrate this feature while maintaining the existing style and user flow of the application.
